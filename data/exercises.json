        "description": "The Sit Command lays the groundwork for all further obedience training. Start in a quiet area with minimal distractions. Hold a treat just above your dog’s nose and slowly move your hand back over its head. As your pup naturally follows the treat, its bottom will lower—at that moment, clearly say “Sit,” reward with the treat, and praise warmly. Repeat 5–10 times per session, gradually phasing out the treat so your dog learns to sit on command alone.",

With your dog on a loose leash, show them the toy, toss it a short distance, and encourage them to chase it. When they pick it up, use a consistent recall cue (like “Here!”) and reward heavily when they return the toy. Gradually increase distance and vary direction to keep it challenging.",

Say “Rollover,” reward, and repeat. Practice a few minutes daily until they link the word to the action.",
